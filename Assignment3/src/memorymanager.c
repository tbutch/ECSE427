    1. Copy the entire file into the backing store.

    4. Our launch paging technique defaults to loading two pages of the program into RAM when it is first launched.
       A page is 4 lines of code. If the program has 4 or less lines of code, then only one page is loaded. 
       If the program has more than 8 lines of code, then only the first two pages are loaded.
    5. Modify the PCB by adding an array: int pageTable[10]; 
       The index of the array is the page number. The values stored in the cell is the frame number.
       The array is size 10 because RAM is size 10 in our simulator (4 lines of code per page).
       The PC must be the offset from the beginning of a frame, where offset is the line count starting from zero.
       Keep int PC as the pointer to the current position in the process. 
       Add int PC_page, PC_offset, pages_max. This tracks which page and offset the program is currently at,
       and the total number of pages in this program.
